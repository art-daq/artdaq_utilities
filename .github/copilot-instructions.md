# Project Overview

This project is a collection of tools and utilities for the artdaq framework, which is used for data acquisition in high-energy physics experiments. The repository includes code for data processing, monitoring, and analysis, as well as documentation and examples to help users get started with artdaq.

## Libraries and Frameworks

artdaq is built on the art framework, which provides a modular and flexible architecture for data processing. It also utilizes various C++ libraries for tasks such as serialization, logging, and configuration management.

artdaq is built using CMake and the Spack package manager. A build environment is provided in the `ghcr.io/art-daq/artdaq-spack` Docker image, which includes all necessary dependencies and tools for building and running artdaq. The build environment is located at /opt/artdaq within the container.

## Coding Standards

All C++ source files must be formatted with `clang-format`. All python files must be formatted with `black`. The project uses the Google C++ Style Guide as a reference for coding standards, with some modifications to fit the specific needs of the artdaq framework. Developers are encouraged to follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.
